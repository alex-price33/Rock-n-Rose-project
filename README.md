This website has been created to show my ability to design and create a website using html and CSS.

Rock and Rose has been created to show a functioning website that allows the user to meet the staff, learn about the company and find out what services Rock and Rose offers to the customer.

## User Experience (UX)
There are two main groups this website is targetting.Its is aimed at current clients and possibly new clients who have came across the website while online.The site is made to be simple and easy to navigate.

## User stories
As the only developer of this website, my goal is to ensure the website is easy to navigate and to provide an easy, informative website that the user can :

-As a user, I want to understand the purpose of this website quickly and easily.
- As a user, I want to easily navigate this website (by using a mouse, a keyboard, or a touch screen).
-As a user, i want to be able to see what services this website offers.
-As a user, i want to be able to see when the shop itself is open.
-As a user, i want to be able to see the staff and there experience.

### Strategy
The goal is to make a well-functioning professional website that entices the user into visiting the salon.

### Scope
For the users i wanted to make a simple informative website that they could easily find all services and any other information they required.

### Structure
My website consinsts of a single scrolling page with 5 sections including a navbar at the top of the page and a fixed footer at the bottom.
**Website Sections:**
1. **_Header/nav:_** This contains the logo and a navbar that links to ther sections of the website.
2. **_About:_** This is just a brief overview of the salon and the aims and ambitions of the owner.
3. **_Services:_** A section of the services and price list of what the salon has to offer .
4. **_Meet the team:_**  This is a section about the staff and there personal instagram links.
5. **_Contact:_** A contact page featuring basic contact information, and a form for the user to enquire with the salon taff
6. **_Footer:_** This is not the main section of the website but rather an ending to the website with social media links.

### Skeleton
The website is designed to be clear and simple. And the site has a simple tree structure with hierarchical flows from top to bottom.

**Wireframe**
The wireframe is designed using Balsamiq software. The first draft was edited with the guidance of the mentor. At first i was planning on making my website on seperate pages but after speaking with my mentor decided that a single scrolling page would be better.
